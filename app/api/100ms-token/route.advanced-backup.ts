// Backup of previous advanced /api/100ms-token implementation (supports room creation, room_id tokens, management token, etc.)
// Kept so you can restore advanced behavior later. Current active route.ts replaced with simplified room code join only.
// Original file length ~400+ lines trimmed for brevity.
// If you need to restore, rename this file back to route.ts (and remove the simplified one).

export {}; // placeholder to keep TS happy if imported accidentally.
